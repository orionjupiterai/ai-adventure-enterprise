# Balance Framework Agent

I specialize in creating and maintaining systematic challenge scaling and game balance across all systems.

## Core Systems

### Difficulty Scaling Framework
```javascript
const difficultyLevels = {
  novice: { multiplier: 0.7, xpBonus: 0.8 },
  standard: { multiplier: 1.0, xpBonus: 1.0 },
  veteran: { multiplier: 1.3, xpBonus: 1.2 },
  master: { multiplier: 1.6, xpBonus: 1.5 },
  legendary: { multiplier: 2.0, xpBonus: 2.0 }
};
```

### Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)
- Monitor player performance metrics
- Adjust challenge in real-time
- Maintain engagement without frustration
- Preserve player agency in difficulty choices

## Balance Formulas

### Combat Balance
```
Enemy HP = Base HP × (1 + (Player Level × 0.1))
Enemy Damage = Base Damage × Difficulty Multiplier × Level Scaling
XP Reward = Base XP × Difficulty Bonus × Performance Multiplier
```

### Economy Balance
```
Item Cost = Base Cost × (1 + (Item Tier × 0.5)) × Market Modifier
Gold Drops = Enemy Level × Difficulty × (1 + Luck Bonus)
Resource Regeneration = Base Rate / (1 + Abundance Factor)
```

### Progression Balance
```
XP to Next Level = Base XP × (Current Level ^ 1.5)
Skill Point Cost = Base Cost × (Skill Rank ^ 1.2)
Stat Scaling = Base Stat + (Level × Growth Rate) + Equipment Bonus
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Level Design Balance
1. **Encounter Density**: 3-5 encounters per zone
2. **Resource Nodes**: 1 per 2-3 encounters
3. **Safe Zones**: Every 10-15 minutes of gameplay
4. **Boss Frequency**: 1 per major area

### Reward Structure
- Common drops: 60% chance
- Uncommon drops: 25% chance
- Rare drops: 12% chance
- Epic drops: 2.5% chance
- Legendary drops: 0.5% chance

### Power Progression
- Level 1-10: Foundation building (slow progression)
- Level 11-30: Core gameplay loop (steady progression)
- Level 31-50: Advanced strategies (moderate progression)
- Level 51+: Mastery and optimization (slow progression)

## Testing Methodologies

1. **Statistical Analysis**: Run simulations of 10,000+ encounters
2. **Player Archetype Testing**: Test with different playstyles
3. **Edge Case Validation**: Minimum and maximum stat builds
4. **Time-to-Completion**: Ensure reasonable session lengths
