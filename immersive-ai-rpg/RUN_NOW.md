# 🎮 The Backend is Running! Here's What to Do Next:

## ✅ Backend Status
The minimal backend server is **currently running** on http://localhost:3001

You can verify this by visiting: http://localhost:3001/health

## 🚀 Start the Frontend

### Option 1: Open a New Terminal/Command Prompt
```bash
cd C:\Users\User\Documents\adventure-platform\immersive-ai-rpg\frontend
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Use Windows Explorer
1. Navigate to `C:\Users\User\Documents\adventure-platform\immersive-ai-rpg\frontend`
2. Right-click in the folder
3. Select "Open in Terminal" or "Open PowerShell window here"
4. Type: `npm run dev`

## 🎯 Access the Game

Once the frontend is running, open your browser and go to:
**http://localhost:3000**

## 🔐 Test Accounts

### Demo Account (Already Created)
- Email: `demo@immersive-rpg.com`
- Password: `DemoAccount123!`

### Or Create Your Own Account

2. Click "Create Account"
3. Fill in the registration form

## 🛑 To Stop the Servers

The backend is currently running in this terminal. To stop it:
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where you see the backend logs

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Registration Still Fails:
1. Make sure the backend shows it's running on port 3001
2. Check that the frontend is proxying to http://localhost:3001
3. Open browser DevTools (F12) and check the Network tab for errors

### If Frontend Won't Start:
- Make sure you're in the `frontend` directory
- Try: `npm install` first, then `npm run dev`
- Check if port 3000 is already in use

## 📝 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Backend (already running)
cd backend
npm run dev:minimal

# Frontend (you need to run this)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🎮 Ready to Play!

2. Start the frontend (see above)
3. Open http://localhost:3000
